# Operating and releasing authenticated applications

This checklist is for maintainers and operators of the full authenticated Azure deployment, not the local getting-started path.

## Diagnostics

Container Apps sends service logs to Log Analytics. Functions is configured with Application Insights. Gateway logs redact authorization/cookies and report request IDs and error types, not raw downstream exception messages.

Use Azure CLI for container revisions, logs, identities, role assignments, and resource status. `status` checks the gateway resource and data-service readiness; it is not an authenticated storage/function smoke test.

## Failure and retry

- A failed CLI command exits nonzero and does not select another platform.
- The command runner waits for process output streams to close before returning, so deployment JSON and error diagnostics are not truncated when the child exits.
- Infrastructure/schema/runtime stages are persisted locally. Retry repeats declarative stages rather than assuming prior state is current.
- Schema failure prevents new gateway/data rollout; existing runtime resources are not intentionally deleted.
- Local lock files are removed on ordinary completion/failure. After an abrupt process termination, verify no deployment is running before removing that environment's exact `.lock` file.
- ARM changes, SQL publishing, and Graph assignments are not a single transaction. Inspect recorded stages and Azure state after failure.
- Runtime rollback does not reverse schema changes. Use expand/contract changes and operator-reviewed recovery.
- Do not run deployment from two unrelated machines simultaneously. CI provides concurrency grouping; a distributed lock service is not implemented.

## Durable data

SQL owns application data and row-level security. Blob owns user files. Files are addressed by tenant/object-ID/name; deleting the application does not require deleting its data.

The SQL administrator intentionally has privileged schema access. The DAB identity receives only table CRUD, and SQL block/filter predicates protect ownership. Gateway and function identities are separate.

Blob shared keys and anonymous access are disabled. File storage uses managed identity. The Functions host receives Blob/Queue/Table roles on the account; gateway permission is scoped to the file container.

Key Vault is provisioned with private access, RBAC, soft delete, and purge protection. `secret-set` writes a value supplied through `SQL_APPS_SECRET_VALUE` without persisting it locally or printing it. The operator needs Key Vault data-plane write permissions and private connectivity; provisioning permissions alone do not grant access.

The function identity has Key Vault Secrets User. Function implementations can import `functionSecrets` from `functions/src/secrets.ts` using `KEY_VAULT_URL` and `FUNCTIONS_IDENTITY_CLIENT_ID`. The example echo function does not read or return secrets. Never expose this helper through a generic client-controlled secret lookup endpoint.

Secret values, like SqlPackage access tokens, pass through the tools' normal process arguments on a trusted deployment host. Do not run deployment/secret operations on an untrusted shared host.

## Production release gates

Before production:

- Run the deployed two-user acceptance suite in [deployment reference](../reference/deployment.md).
- Verify network isolation and DNS from both trusted and untrusted hosts.
- Pin every deployed image to an immutable digest, including validated base image provenance.
- Exercise multiple replicas, temporary SQL outage, and dependency recovery.
- Perform and document a SQL restore drill and Blob retention recovery.
- Set SQL backup retention according to policy; do not treat default retention as an approved recovery plan.
- Configure alert rules and cost budgets for the selected environment.
- Verify tenant consent restrictions and least-privilege directory/resource deployment permissions.
- Exercise CI SQL authentication/private networking; hosted GitHub runners do not inherently reach private endpoints.
- Record regional quota/SKU availability and cost estimates.

No automatic resource-deletion command is provided. Resource deletion, database restore, retention changes, and destructive migrations require explicit operator review.
