# Contributing

Thank you for your interest in SQL Apps.
We welcome thoughtful contributions from both individual developers and AI-assisted workflows.

## Contributor License Agreement

Most contributions require you to
agree to a Contributor License Agreement (CLA) declaring that you have the right to,
and actually do, grant us the rights to use your contribution. For details, visit
[Contributor License Agreements portal](https://cla.opensource.microsoft.com).

When you submit a pull request, a CLA-bot will automatically determine whether you need
to provide a CLA and decorate the PR appropriately (e.g., label, comment). Simply follow the
instructions provided by the bot. You will only need to do this once across all repositories using our CLA.

## Code of Conduct

This project follows the [Microsoft Open Source Code of Conduct](https://opensource.microsoft.com/codeofconduct/).
For more information see the [Code of Conduct FAQ](https://opensource.microsoft.com/codeofconduct/faq/)
or contact [opencode@microsoft.com](mailto:opencode@microsoft.com) with any additional questions or comments.

## How to Contribute

### Reporting Bugs

Use the [Bug Report](https://github.com/microsoft/sql-apps/issues/new?template=bug.yml) issue template. Include reproduction steps and redacted validation evidence.

### Requesting Features

Use the [Feature Request](https://github.com/microsoft/sql-apps/issues/new?template=feature-request.yml) issue template. Describe your use case and the expected behavior.

### Submitting Pull Requests

1. Fork the repository and create a branch for your change.
2. Keep pull requests scoped to a focused set of changes.
3. Include a clear description of the change and its rationale.
4. Run any existing linters, builds, and tests before submitting.

Validate changes with `npm test`, `npm run typecheck`, `npm run sql:build`, `npm run infra:build`, and `npm run dab:validate` as applicable. Include each exact command and result; distinguish local/mocked results from live Azure acceptance.

Keep end-user walkthroughs in `docs/guides`, detailed commands in `docs/reference`, and contributor contracts in `docs/maintainers`. See the [documentation index](docs/README.md), [application boundaries](docs/maintainers/application-boundary.md) and [operations checks](docs/maintainers/operations.md).

## AI-Assisted Contributions

We encourage transparent use of AI agents, copilots, and other tools that accelerate high-quality contributions.
If AI helped you create the contribution, disclose the tools used and how they influenced the work in your pull request or issue summary.

When submitting AI-assisted changes, make sure that you:

- Test the changes yourself and share the results or reproduction steps.
- Understand the code you are contributing so that you can answer follow-up questions.
- Explain why the change is needed and how it improves SQL Apps.
- Provide evidence such as screenshots, logs, or test output when fixes or features require verification.

We may close contributions that:

- Appear to be untested or copy-pasted without human review.
- Offer generic suggestions that do not address specific SQL Apps needs.
- Consist of bulk submissions with no clear analysis or rationale.

Repeated submissions that ignore these guidelines may lead to additional review requirements or contribution limits.
Respect the maintainers' time and keep communication clear, direct, and professional.
